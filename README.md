I Have been Creating Augmented Reality Project Using Unity
In this Project I first start by Creating a Viforia Account and importing the vuforia package inside the unity
After that I was Creat a good image target 
Then I Capture an image which can be used as image target 
Next i was created a vuforia License key and Upload my Image target Inside the Vuforia Database 
Then i was Activated the Webcam and Project a Human Art 3D Model on top of the image target 
Creating a Vuforia Account,After I Have been Imported the Vuforia SDK Insside Unity
To Convert a Normal Unity Project into an Augmented Reality Project
Select the Image Taeget Dropdown to Unity
Change this option from Image to Database
After click on the Dropdown Image Target Select the AR2 Database
The Database Contains Only One Image Target
The Widh of Image Target is five
After Viforia has Automatically Calculated the height for us
Next add the 3D Model 
Already i have one Barberian 3D Model 
Drag this Barbarian FBX file inside the  hierachy
After this Barbarian is placed exactly in AR2 Image Target
Click on the Play Button barberian Model is Looking towards us
I had changed the Wrap mood of the Wakling Animation to loop
The Barberian is Walking Continously
Next Build and run this Application inside on an Android Smartphone
First CrossCheck wethere the JDK and SDK part are set up Properly inside Unity
Finally i was build this Complete Project and Test output.
